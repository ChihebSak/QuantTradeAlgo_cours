# Overview:

This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive introduction to algorithmic trading using Python. The project utilizes the IEX API as the primary data source and various Python libraries including Pandas, Requests, NumPy, and more. Algorithmic trading is a method of executing orders using automated pre-programmed trading instructions accounting for variables such as time, price, and volume.

# Features:

This project is divided into three sub-projects, each focusing on different aspects of algorithmic trading:

## 1. S&P500 Index Fund Equivalent
This section aims to introduce the concept of creating an S&P500 index fund equivalent portfolio. Users will learn how to analyze historical data of the S&P500 index components, construct a portfolio that closely mimics the performance of the S&P500, and implement trading strategies to maintain the portfolio's composition.

## 2. Momentum-based Stock Selector
In this sub-project, users will explore momentum-based trading strategies and market analysis metrics to select stocks with high growth potential. The implementation involves analyzing historical price data, calculating momentum indicators, and identifying stocks with strong upward trends for potential investment opportunities.

## 3. Value-based Stock Selector
The value-based stock selector sub-project focuses on identifying undervalued stocks using fundamental analysis metrics. Users will learn how to screen stocks based on factors such as price-to-earnings ratio, price-to-book ratio, and other fundamental indicators to identify potential investment opportunities with favorable valuation metrics.
